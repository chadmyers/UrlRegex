UrlRegex
========

_UrlRegex_ is a regex pattern designed originally by John Gruber for detecting 
URLs that occur among a blog of wild and crazy human-entered text.

It's not perfect, but the intent is to handle most common and uncommon scenarios.

[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) is the originator of this regex. 
You can read his 
[blog post](http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls) 
for more background on how he developed it.

According to his blog post, he has released his original regex as public domain.
